# Design Patterns in PHP

This repository provides a collection of examples that demonstrate the implementation of design patterns. 

---

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by design pattern, with each pattern having its own directory. Inside each pattern's directory, you will find:

1. **Illustrative**
    - Demonstrates the theoretical implementation of the pattern in a simplified and abstract context.
    - These examples focus on explaining the core idea of the pattern, often using scenarios that are unlikely to appear in real-world applications.

2. **Practical**
    - Provides real-world examples of how the pattern can be applied in a PHP project.
    - These examples are closer to production-ready code and aim to demonstrate the utility of the pattern in solving common programming problems.
